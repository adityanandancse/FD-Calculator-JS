# Fixed Deposit (FD) Calculator

A web-based Fixed Deposit (FD) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool helps users easily calculate the maturity amount of an FD based on parameters such as principal amount, interest rate, compounding frequency, and investment tenure.

## Demo

https://fdcalculator-five.vercel.app/

## Features

- **Real-Time Calculations**: Instant results as users adjust input values.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that users enter valid values for principal, tenure, and interest rate.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, responsive design for seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile.

## How It Works

The FD calculator uses the compound interest formula to compute the maturity amount:

\[
A = P*(1+r/n)n*t
\]

Where:
- \( A \) = Maturity Amount
- \( P \) = Principal Amount
- \( r \) = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal)
- \( n \) = Compounding Frequency (1 for annual, 4 for quarterly, etc.)
- \( t \) = Investment Tenure (in years)

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityanandancse/fd-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter the principal amount, interest rate, and tenure.
2. View the calculated maturity amount and interest earned in real time.

## Technologies Used
